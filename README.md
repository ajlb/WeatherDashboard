## Introduction ##

This weather dasboard gets current weather, forecast data and uv index from the openweathermap api via AJAX, JQuery and JS. It uses three APIs from openweathermap: 
- Current weather: https://openweathermap.org/api
- UV Index: https://openweathermap.org/api/uvi
- 5 day forecast: https://openweathermap.org/forecast5

 It also utilizes bootstrap and css to make the application responsive.

## Usage ##
